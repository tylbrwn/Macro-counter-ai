# Macronutrients-counter-ai
IT Project 

    Train food recognition model:

- Teachable machine (https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/train)

  
- Train the model to recognize pictures of common foods.

      Upload Arduino Code:

- Upload to Arduino IDE

-The code should light up different color lights if it has the reccomended amount of protein, carbohydrates or fats.

    Connect Python code to Arduino:

-Put Python code into Visual Studio Code


-Code should reference the food recognition model and OpenAI's 3.5 model to find the food and estimated macronutrients.

    Systems used:

-Python 3.12


-Google Teachable Machine


-Tensor Flow


-Arduino IDE


-Ardiuno Mega 2560


-OpenCV


-PySerial
