# Macronutrients-counter-ai
IT Project 

In this project we are going to make an AI Macronutrient counter. The goal is to have be able to put food in front of a camera and have the model recognize the food and use OpenAI to find the macronutrients and light up designated lights to signal if the food has the recommended amount of protein, carbohydrates or fats.

    Train food recognition model:

- Teachable machine (https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/train)

  
- Train the model to recognize pictures of common foods.

      Upload Arduino Code:

- Upload to Arduino IDE

-The code should light up different color lights if it has the reccomended amount of protein, carbohydrates or fats.

    Connect Python code to Arduino:

-Put Python code into Visual Studio Code


-Code should reference the food recognition model and OpenAI's 3.5 model to find the food and estimated macronutrients.

    Systems used:

-Python 3.12


-Google Teachable Machine


-Tensor Flow


-Arduino IDE


-Ardiuno Mega 2560


-OpenCV


-PySerial
